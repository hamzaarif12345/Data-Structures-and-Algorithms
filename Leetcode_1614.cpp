Hint
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3*/


class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        int max_num = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                count++;
                if (max_num < count)
                    max_num = count;
            } else if (c == ')') {
                count--;
            }
        }
        return max_num;
    }
};
